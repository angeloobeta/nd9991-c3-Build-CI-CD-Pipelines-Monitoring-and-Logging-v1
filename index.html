        <pre>Local repositories are typically limited to file system access. 
             They are usually only visible from the master node. 
             Local repositories are also known to require more complicated path 
             names on Windows computers than most users want to manage. 
             Users are advised to run jobs on agents rather than running them 
             directly on the master. 
             For those reasons, use a remote repository rather than a 
             local repository for the best Blue Ocean experience
